      <h2 class="page-subheader">New General Catalogue (NGC)</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        The New General Catalogue (formally A New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, being the
        Catalogue
        of the Late Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., revised, corrected, and enlarged or NGC, abbreviated) is a catalogue
        of star clusters, nebulae and galaxies compiled by Danish astronomer Johan Ludvig Emil Dreyer in 1888. Dreyer
        based the catalogue on earlier work by the British Herschel family, and originally contained 7,840 objects,
        though
        he added an additional 5,386 objects in later editions. It is a common reference for astronomers today, though
        it
        lacks objects that are only visible with modern equipment.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Apparent Magnitude</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        The magnitude listed on this site is the apparent magnitude – the brightness as seen by an observer a certain
        distance from an object. Since apparent magnitude is affected by distance – an object appears brighter the
        closer
        you are – two objects emitting/reflecting different amounts of light could appear to be the same brightness.”
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Distance (kilo light years)</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        The distance of objects is measured in kilo light years. A light year is the distance light can travel in a year
        –
        9,460,000,000,000 (9.46 trillion) kilometers. For context, the circumference (distance around) the earth is
        about
        40,070 kilometers, so a light year is roughly equivalent to flying around the earth 236 million times! A kilo
        light year is 1,000 light years, 9,460,000,000 (9.46 billion) kilometers.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Right Ascension (RA)</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Right ascension is similar to longitude, and measures a celestial object’s location along the east/west axis. It
        begins at the vernal equinox, or the spot that the sun arrives at on the first day of spring, in the
        constellation
        Pisces. From there, the east/west circle can be broken down into 24 “hours”, or 15° sections. An object’s RA is
        measured in hours/minutes according to this system.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Declination (Dec)</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        o Declination is similar to latitude, and measures a celestial object’s location along the north/south axis. It
        is
        measured from the celestial equator and is measured positively above this point and negatively below it. The
        north
        celestial pole is then labelled +90°, while the south celestial pole is labelled -90°.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Object Size (Arcminutes, Arcseconds)</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        The size of these objects is listed in arc minutes and arc seconds. In astronomy, one degree is made up of 60
        arc
        minutes, while an arc minute is made up of 60 arc seconds. This breakdown allows for more accurate measurements.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Constellation</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Constellations are commonly recognized groupings of stars in astronomy. They can aid astronomers in finding
        celestial objects, and are listed to help locate the Messier objects in relation to them.
      </p></br>

      </br>
      <h1 class="page-title">Object Types</h1>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Open Clusters</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Open clusters are made up of stars that were probably formed from a nebula around the same time – they’re
        smaller
        than globular clusters, with dozens to hundreds of stars, and are usually younger than globular clusters.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Globular Clusters</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Globular clusters are near-spherical clusters of stars that formed around the same time. They contain incredibly
        old stars, and are far larger than open clusters, with hundreds of thousands of stars.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Bright/Diffuse Nebulae</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Diffuse nebulae are clouds of gas and dust associated with star formation. Young stars can cause the gas in
        these
        nebulae to shine; nebulae like this are called emission nebulae. If the stars aren’t hot enough, the light can
        reflect off the dust, creating a reflection nebula.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Planetary Nebulae</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        When a star begins to die, its core, formerly the location of nuclear fusion, collapses to become a white dwarf,
        and its outer layers are shed, creating a planetary nebula.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Galaxies</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Galaxies are systems of stars and other matter that make up the universe. Galaxies can interact gravitationally
        and merge, and larger galaxies can strip smaller galaxies of stars and interstellar matter. Edwin Hubble first
        split galaxies into three categories: spiral, elliptical and irregular. Galaxies are incredibly diverse, making
        these categorizations too simple in some cases.
      </p></br>

      <h2 class="page-subheader">Double/Binary Stars</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Double or binary star systems are systems in which two stars are gravitationally bound and orbit one another. In
        some systems, the stars are so close they can strip material from one another, while stars in other systems have
        more distance between them. The double star in the Messier Catalogue is not a true double star system, but two
        stars that appear to be.
