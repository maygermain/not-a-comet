      <h1 class="page-title">Charles Messier + the Catalogue</h1>
      <p class="page-text">
        Charles Messier (1730-1817) was a comet hunter who developed what was later published as the Messier Catalogue.
        During his course of study, he found objects that could be mistaken as comets, and was inspired to create a
        catalogue of these objects to minimize errors. In his time, “nebula” was used to describe any sort of “faint
        fuzzy”
        or celestial object; while the catalog does contain what are now categorized as nebulae, it also contains what
        were
        later discovered to be galaxies.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        The catalogue was originally published with a mere 45 objects, which Messier later expanded to 103 objects.
        Objects
        discovered by his collaborator Pierre Méchain were also added, along with M31, which Messier had discovered but
        not
        added to the original catalogue. The catalogue, as it stands today, contains 110 diverse objects, including the
        Andromeda Galaxy, Orion Nebula, and Pleiades.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Since the objects were viewed with a relatively small telescope compared to today’s technology, many of these
        objects are visible to the naked eye, binoculars, or a small telescope, though a few do require a larger
        telescope
        to resolve details.
